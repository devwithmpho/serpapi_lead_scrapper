# Serpapi Lead Scraper

This tool uses the serpapi library to scrape data from places on Google Maps.
It fetches the data using the API, cleans it, and puts it into a CSV file.

Note: It is hardcoded to search areas in Gauteng and is specific to South Africa.
In future I may add a basic UI to allow for custom locations.

The reason why I built this is because I am running a business and need a quick automated method for finding leads.
With this tool, the only thing I do manually is filter by the best leads.
