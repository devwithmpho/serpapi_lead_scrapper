# Serpapi Lead Scraper

This tool uses the serpapi library to scrape data from places on Google Maps.
It fetches the data using the API, cleans it, and puts it into a CSV file.

Note: It is hardcoded to search areas in Gauteng.

The reason why I built this is because I am starting a business and need a faster than manual method for finding leads.
With this tool, the only thing I do manually is filter by the best leads.
